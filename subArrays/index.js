1. TO get number of subarrays present is

formula: n*(n+1)/2

2. To get number of subarray where i index is present

example: [1,2,3,4] and index i is 0;

formula is: (i+1) * (N - i)

explanation: if here index is start from 1 then end cant be 0 thats why start index will always b:  0 and 1 and end index will be from 1 to end.

here elements at index 1 is 2 that is arr[0] and arr[1] and end can be ith index to end that is (N-i)






Question1: Print all subarrays
Question2: Print all subarray sum
Question3: Find the sum of all subarray
