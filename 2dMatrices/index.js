/*

const array = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
];


we have two types of diagnoal in the square matrix:

1. principal diagonal
2. Anti-diagonal


question1: 

Given mat[M][N]. Print the row-wise sum

const array = [
  [1, 2, 3, 4],
  [5, 6, 7, 8],
  [9, 10, 11, 12],
];


question2: 

Given mat[M][N]. Print the col-wise sum

const array = [
   [1, 2, 3, 4],
  [5, 6, 7, 8],
  [9, 10, 11, 12],
];
