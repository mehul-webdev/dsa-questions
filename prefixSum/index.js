Question 1: 

GIven N array elements and Q queries. For each query, calculate sum of all elements from L to R (0 Based Indexing).

Example: let arr = [-3,6,2,4,5,2,8,-9,3,1]

Queries(Q): 5

L R
4 8 -> 9
3 7 -> 10
1 3 -> 12
0 4 -> 14
7 7 -> -9

/* 

    question 2: 
    Find the number of equilibrium index in the given array of size N where equilibrium index is defined as: 

    sum of all elements to the left of index === sum of all elements to the right of index.


    Note: for i = 0; left_sum = 0 and for i = N-1, right_sum = 0;

    let arr = [-3,2,4,1]

/*

Question 3

Given N array elements & Q queries. For each query, find count of even number in [L,R] range.

let arr = [2,4,3,7,9,8,6,5,4,9];

let queries = [[4,8],[3,9],[0,4]]
